# DQN — Deep Q-Network (part of Deep RL Algorithm Suite)

This folder contains a clean, minimal, and well-documented implementation of the DQN agent
used in the Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Suite. It is intended for **low-dimensional**
control tasks (e.g., LunarLander-v2). For pixel-based Atari tasks use the CNN variant and
the `kungfu/` or `pacman/` environment folders.
